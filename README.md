# Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction-Training

- This model predicts the quality of red wine and I created this model in my 1 month training during 3rd year of B.tech. <br>
- The model takes the following inputs:
  >Citric Acid <br>
  >Fixed Acidity <br>
  >Total Sulphur Dioxide <br>
  >Volatile Acidity <br>
  >Sulphates <br>
  >Density <br>
  >Alcohol <br>
 
Based on these input values, the model tells whether the wine quality is good or bad.

- I have also performed feature selection in this model and handled the imbalanced data in data-set.  <br>
- The Model is deployed at https://redwinequalitypredict.herokuapp.com/ (zoom in or zoom out to fit input dialog box to your screen)<br>
- This is how the web page looks (you can also use the above link to test it out) <br>
