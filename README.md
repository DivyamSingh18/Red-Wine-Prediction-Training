# Wine-Quality-Predictor

This model predicts the quality of red wine and I created this model in my 1 month training during 3rd year of B.tech.
The Model is deployed at https://redwinequalitypredict.herokuapp.com/

The model takes the following inputs:
>Citric Acid
>Fixed Acidity
>Total Sulphur Dioxide
>Volatile Acidity
>Sulphates
>Density
>Alcohol
